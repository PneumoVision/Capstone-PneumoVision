# PneumoVision

PneumoVision is an innovative app that uses AI technology to detect pneumonia through lung X-Ray scans, helping to improve healthcare practices in Indonesia. Based on WHO data, pneumonia is the leading cause of childhood death worldwide, with a growing prevalence in Indonesia. In 2018, there were 478,078 pneumonia patients in Indonesia, and the mortality rate reached 43,764 in 2017, demonstrating the urgency of early diagnosis. PneumoVision offers a solution with fast and accurate diagnosis, integrated with cloud computing and machine learning models. It uses technologies such as LiveData and ViewModel for up-to-date data, Retrofit and Kotlin Coroutines for efficient data retrieval, Glide for image management, and Material Components for modern UI design. With this, PneumoVision reduces the burden on medical personnel and improves patient care, supporting the improvement of healthcare quality through early disease detection.
